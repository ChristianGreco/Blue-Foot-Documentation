# Blue Foot: Page Builder Blocks
## Overview
The page builder is built up of a number of different page builder blocks. Each of these blocks represents a different bit of content. This could be a heading, textarea or even a slider. Each of these blocks are built up using Magento's built in EAV structure. A page builder block can have any number of fields and groups assigned to it. Allowing anyone to utilise BlueFoot to create reusable and beautiful blocks.

### Admin Interface
To start you'll need to build up your blocks fields and structure. This can be done directly in the admin under `System > BlueFoot > Page Builder Blocks > Add Page Builder Block`.
